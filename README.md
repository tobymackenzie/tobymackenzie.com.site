tobymackenzie.com (site)
========================

This is the code that runs [Toby Mackenzie's primary website](https://www.tobymackenzie.com).  It uses [Symfony](https://symfony.com) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.org).  Server configured by my [tobymackenzie.srv repo](https://github.com/tobymackenzie/tobymackenzie.srv).

I'm not sure what I intend to do for the license, so it doesn't have one currently.
