{#-!
special stylesheet for ancient browsers, normal one for modern
`only all` cuts off ie8- and very old browsers

- I rarely test in old browsers, and don't want to have to worry about changes breaking things in them
- many properties can have unexpected bugs on ancient browsers
- some selectors or properties may not be handled by ancient browsers, which may result in unexpected combinations of applied styles
- html5 elements can't be styled by ie8- and old firefox without js html5shiv. doesn't work ie5 mac at all

this solution causes the problems:

- an extra stylesheet request is made by modern browsers
- modern sheet has to undo some of ancient sheet
- more maintenance work
- extra markup in shell
- ie 6-8 with js enabled rendered the site decently, but now get limited styles

{#-#
script `type="application/javascript"` to block some old browsers.  blocks IE8- except IE5 mac, NN3 asks to download scripts (even without type)
- prevents needing to worry about supporting them with js features: have very low usage rates
- prevents Moz1 from throwing up 3 security exception dialogs
#}
{#-- support styling html5 elements in IE8-. just use cdn since it's quick and easy, people using IE8- will be likely to have this cached, won't be affected by CSP, and probably don't care as much about privacy / security #}
